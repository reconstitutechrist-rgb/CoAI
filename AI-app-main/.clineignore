# .clineignore - Reduce Cline's context size to save cache write tokens
# 
# This file works like .gitignore but controls what Cline can see in your project.
# Files/folders listed here won't appear in environment_details, reducing cache token usage.

# ============================================================================
# HIGH IMPACT: Archive folder (~50+ files = ~500-800 tokens saved per cache write)
# ============================================================================
archive/

# ============================================================================
# MEDIUM IMPACT: Uncomment these lines if you want further token reduction
# ============================================================================

# Documentation folders
# docs/

# Test files (uncomment when not working on tests)
 tests/
 **/__tests__/
 **/__mocks__/
 **/*.test.ts
 **/*.test.js
 **/*.spec.ts

# Build artifacts and dependencies
# node_modules/
# .next/
# dist/
# build/
# .vercel/

# Configuration files (uncomment if rarely modified)
# *.config.js
# *.config.ts
# package-lock.json
# tsconfig.json
# .gitignore
# .npmrc
# vercel.json

# ============================================================================
# USAGE NOTES:
# ============================================================================
# 
# 1. START SMALL: Currently only excluding archive/ (biggest impact, lowest risk)
# 2. TEST IMPACT: Check your cache token usage after creating a new Cline task
# 3. EXPAND GRADUALLY: Uncomment additional sections if you need more reduction
# 4. OVERRIDE WHEN NEEDED: Use @filename mentions to include excluded files
# 5. TEMPORARY DISABLE: Comment out lines with # when you need access
#
# Expected reduction from archive/ exclusion: 25-40% fewer cache write tokens
