# 🕒 Version Control System

Complete guide to version control, undo/redo, fork, and compare features.

---

## 📋 Overview

Every modification to your app creates a new version automatically. You have complete history with the ability to undo, redo, fork, compare, and revert to any previous version.

### Key Features
- ✅ **Automatic version saving** on every change
- ✅ **Unlimited undo/redo** (until page refresh)
- ✅ **Fork/branch** to create alternatives
- ✅ **Compare versions** side-by-side
- ✅ **One-click revert** to any version
- ✅ **Version metadata** (timestamp, description, change type)

---

## 🔄 Automatic Version Saving

### When Versions Are Created
A new version is saved when:
- ✅ New app is generated (marked as `NEW_APP`)
- ✅ Major change is applied (marked as `MAJOR_CHANGE`)
- ✅ Minor change is applied (marked as `MINOR_CHANGE`)
- ✅ Undo/redo operation is performed
- ✅ Version is reverted

### What's Saved in Each Version
```typescript
{
  id: "1730583600000",
  versionNumber: 1,
  code: "/* complete app code */",
  description: "Initial app creation",
  timestamp: "2025-11-02T20:00:00.000Z",
  changeType: "NEW_APP"
}
```

### Version Numbers
- Start at 1 for new apps
- Increment sequentially
- Never reset (even with undo/redo)
- Used for identification and comparison

## ⏮️ Undo System

### How to Undo
**Keyboard**: `Ctrl+Z` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Z` (Mac)
**Mouse**: Click the **↶** button in preview toolbar

### What Happens When You Undo
1. Current version moved to **redo stack**
2. Previous version restored from **undo stack**
3. App reverts to previous state
4. Preview updates automatically
5. Undo button updates (disabled if no more undos)

### Undo Stack
- **Unlimited history** (until page refresh)
- Each undo operation stores one version
- Making a new change clears the redo stack
- Visual feedback: Button disabled when empty

### Example Workflow
```
1. Generate app (v1)
2. Add dark mode (v2)
   Undo stack: [v1]
3. Change button color (v3)
   Undo stack: [v1, v2]
4. Press Ctrl+Z → Back to v2
   Undo stack: [v1]
   Redo stack: [v3]
5. Press Ctrl+Z → Back to v1
   Undo stack: []
   Redo stack: [v2, v3]
```

---

## ⏭️ Redo System

### How to Redo
**Keyboard**: 
- `Ctrl+Shift+Z` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+Z` (Mac)
- `Ctrl+Y` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Y` (Mac)

**Mouse**: Click the **↷** button in preview toolbar

### What Happens When You Redo
1. Current version moved to **undo stack**
2. Next version restored from **redo stack**
3. App advances to next state
4. Preview updates automatically
5. Redo button updates (disabled if no more redos)

### Redo Stack Clearing
The redo stack is **cleared** when:
- ❌ You make a new change (edit/generate/modify)
- ❌ You revert to a different version
- ❌ You fork the app

**Why?** To prevent confusing branched histories. Once you make a new change, the "future" is rewritten.

### Example Workflow
```
1. At v3, press Ctrl+Z twice → Back to v1
   Redo stack: [v2, v3]
2. Press Ctrl+Shift+Z → Forward to v2
   Redo stack: [v3]
3. Press Ctrl+Shift+Z → Forward to v3
   Redo stack: []
4. Make new change → v4 created
   Redo stack: [] (cleared)
```

---

## 🍴 Fork/Branch System

### What is Forking?
**Forking** creates an independent copy of your app (or a specific version) that you can modify without affecting the original.

### When to Fork
- ✅ **Experimentation**: Try radical changes safely
- ✅ **A/B testing**: Create two approaches to compare
- ✅ **Checkpointing**: Save stable state before risky changes
- ✅ **Variations**: Create themed versions (light/dark, different colors)
- ✅ **Recovery**: Fork from old version if current is broken

### How to Fork

**Method 1: Fork Current App**
1. Click **🍴 Fork** button in preview toolbar
2. New app created: "Original Name - Fork"
3. Opens in current view
4. Original still in library

**Method 2: Fork from History**
1. Open version history (🕒)
2. Find version to fork
3. Click **🍴 Fork** on that version
4. New app created from that version

**Method 3: Fork from Comparison**
1. Compare two versions
2. Click **🍴 Fork Version X**
3. Creates fork of selected version

### Fork Metadata
```typescript
{
  id: "new-unique-id",
  name: "Todo App - Fork",
  code: "/* code from forked version */",
  description: "Todo App (forked from v3)",
  timestamp: "2025-11-02T20:30:00.000Z",
  versions: [{
    versionNumber: 1,
    description: "Forked from Todo App",
    changeType: "NEW_APP"
  }]
}
```

### Fork Independence
- ✅ **Completely separate** app
- ✅ **Own version history** (starts at v1)
- ✅ **Own undo/redo** stacks
- ✅ **Can modify freely** without affecting original
- ✅ **Can fork again** to create more variations

---

## 🔍 Compare Versions

### Opening Comparison
**Method 1: From History**
1. Open version history

## 🎯 Version Control Strategies

### Strategy 1: Checkpoint-Based
**Best for**: Large, complex apps

**Process**:
1. Build core features (v1-v5)
2. Test thoroughly
3. Note "stable" version (e.g., v5)
4. Try experimental features (v6-v8)
5. If experiment fails, revert to v5
6. Try different approach

**Benefits**:
- Safe experimentation
- Easy recovery
- Clear milestones

---

### Strategy 2: Iterative Refinement
**Best for**: UI/design tweaking

**Process**:
1. Generate initial design (v1)
2. Make change (v2)
3. Review in preview
4. Like it? Keep it
5. Don't like it? Ctrl+Z
6. Try different change
7. Repeat until perfect

**Benefits**:
- Rapid iteration
- Immediate feedback
- Zero risk

---

### Strategy 3: Parallel Exploration
**Best for**: Major feature decisions

**Process**:
1. Create stable base (v1)
2. Fork to "Approach A"
3. Fork to "Approach B"
4. Develop each independently
5. Compare results
6. Pick winner or combine best parts

**Benefits**:
- Compare real implementations
- No what-ifs
- Data-driven decisions

---

### Strategy 4: Recovery Points
**Best for**: Risky modifications

**Process**:
1. Reach stable state (v7)
2. Note version number
3. Attempt risky change (v8)
4. If it breaks:
   - Option A: Undo (Ctrl+Z)
   - Option B: Revert to v7
   - Option C: Fork from v7, start over
5. If it works: Continue from v8

**Benefits**:
- Confidence to experiment
- Easy rollback
- Multiple recovery options

---

## 💾 Data Persistence

### What's Saved
**In Browser localStorage**:
- All apps in library
- Each app's version history
- Current app state

**Not saved**:
- Undo/redo stacks (cleared on refresh)
- Temporary UI state
- Comparison selections

### When Data Persists
- ✅ Page refresh
- ✅ Browser restart
- ✅ Multiple tabs (shared)

### When Data is Lost
- ❌ Clear browser data
- ❌ Incognito/private mode (when closed)
- ❌ Different browser/device
- ❌ LocalStorage quota exceeded

### Backup Strategy
**Export regularly**:
1. Click **📦 Export** on important apps
2. Download ZIP files
3. Store safely
4. Can reimport later if needed

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Undo button is disabled"
**Cause**: No undo history available

**Solutions**:
- Check if any changes were made
- Undo stack clears on page refresh
- Use version history to revert instead

---

### "Redo cleared after making change"
**Cause**: This is intentional behavior

**Why**: Prevents confusing branched histories

**Workaround**: 
- Fork before making change
- Compare versions to see lost redos
- Be intentional about forward/backward movement

---

### "Version history shows no versions"
**Cause**: App hasn't been modified yet

**Solutions**:
- Make a change to create first version
- Version history only shows modifications
- Initial generation doesn't create version until first change

---

### "Lost all history after refresh"
**Cause**: Undo/redo stacks are in-memory only

**Solutions**:
- Use version history instead (persists)
- Revert to old versions from history
- Fork to preserve current state before risky changes

---
